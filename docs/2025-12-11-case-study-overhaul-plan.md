## Case Study 1: SimsCo Mechanical Plumbing

### Knowledge Base Reference:
- File: `2025-12-11-simsco-mechanical.md`
- Engagement: $400/week ($1,600/month)
- Duration: 7 months (ongoing)
- Industry: HVAC, Plumbing, Mechanical Services

### What to Change:

**Client Name:**
- OLD: "SimsCo Electric"
- NEW: "SimsCo Mechanical Plumbing"

**Industry:**
- OLD: "Local Trades"
- NEW: "HVAC / Plumbing"

**Challenge:**
- OLD: "SimsCo was getting lost in the Google shuffle. Their 2012-era website wasn't mobile-friendly..."
- NEW: "Great plumbers, invisible online. In the service business, that's called 'starving with full toolboxes.' They needed to stand out in the local market without spending $5K/month."

**Solution:**
- OLD: "We built a modern booking funnel..."
- NEW: "Complete local SEO domination for $400/week. Google Business Profile optimization, social media that actually generates leads (not stock photos), website improvements, and strategic consulting. Multiple paying jobs per week, every week."

**Results:**
- OLD: ["Booked calls went from 12/month to 47/month...", ...]
- NEW: ["30-40 new opportunities monthly from our work", "300-900% ROI (conservative estimate)", "Multiple paying jobs every single week", "First page rankings for primary local keywords"]

**Testimonial:**
- OLD: "I was skeptical about the whole 'AI thing'... (Mike Simmons, Owner, SimsCo Electric)"
- NEW: "You guys are amazing. Best decision we made. We're getting jobs every week from what you're doing. Don't change anything. This is working." (SimsCo Team)

**Metrics:**
- OLD: Monthly Qualified Leads: 47, Project Value Increase: +32%, Time Saved Weekly: 8 hrs
- NEW: Monthly ROI: 300-900%, Weekly Leads: 8-12, Monthly Revenue Impact: $5K-$15K

- Timeline: 21 days planned → 2 days delivered (19 days early)
- Industry: Medicare Insurance

### What to Change:

**Challenge:**
- OLD: "Medicare enrollment season is insane..."
- NEW: "Medicare is confusing. People take MONTHS to decide. Traditional lead gen = form spam. Most funnels feel like used car sales. Kyle wanted a 'Think Different' approach that treats 65-year-olds like intelligent adults."

**Solution:**
- OLD: "Created a 7-question quiz funnel..."
- NEW: "Three complete Medicare funnels with intent-based qualification, AI personalization, GoHighLevel V2 integration, plus $3,200 in surprise bonuses (30-day social calendar, 20 HeyGen scripts, complete debug suite). Delivered in 2 days instead of 21."

**Results:**
- OLD: ["Funnel conversion jumped from 23% to 67%...", ...]
- NEW: ["Delivered 19 days early with 160% ROI", "$2K investment → $5.2K value delivered", "67% conversion (up from 23%)", "$3.2M qualified pipeline Q4 2024", "Kyle's exact reaction: 'Holy shit'"]

**Metrics:**
- Keep current (Conversion Rate: 67%, Q4 Pipeline: $3.2M, Time Saved: -60%)

- Value Delivered: $180,000+ (900% ROI)

### What to Change:

**Challenge:**

- NEW: "Teaching infinite banking is complex. Text-heavy sites convert at 4% and feel intimidating. Chris needed to educate skeptical entrepreneurs without overwhelming them or sounding like a scam."

**Solution:**
- OLD: "Redesigned the entire site with 'education-first' approach..."
- NEW: "Complete ecosystem transformation: Educational platform (~$30K value), Legacy Command Center AI (~$100K+ value with 250+ field extraction), 12+ applications and tools, multi-AI orchestration, GoHighLevel V2 with 250+ custom fields, Three.js visualizations."

**Results:**
- OLD: ["Site conversion increased from 4% to 19%...", ...]
- NEW: ["$20K investment → $180K+ value (900% ROI)", "Site conversion: 4% → 19%", "Time on site: 47 sec → 7 min 23 sec", "49 blog posts, 340% SEO traffic increase", "Idea → multi-million dollar empire"]

- NEW: "Crisis-responsive Progressive Web App with smart branching logic, multilingual support (English/Spanish), 100+ verified Travis County resources, one-click emergency calling, 24/7 accessibility. Intake time: 45 min → 8 min."

**Results:**
- OLD: ["Intake time reduced from 45 min/family to 8 minutes", ...]
- NEW: ["2,000+ monthly visitors finding help", "Caseworkers freed up 60 hours/month", "95% completion rate (families don't drop off)", "Families get resources 3x faster", "Priceless community impact"]

**Metrics:**

**Challenge:**
- OLD: "ReLid makes custom replacement lids..."

**Solution:**
- OLD: "Built a custom Next.js e-commerce site..."
- NEW: "Custom Next.js e-commerce with visual product configurator (real-time 3D previews), bold American industrial design system, Stripe checkout, zero monthly platform fees. Made aluminum packaging technology look like the future."

**Results:**
- OLD: ["Moved off Etsy to own brand domain...", ...]
- NEW: ["Etsy → Own brand domain (100% profit, not 93.5%)", "45% AOV increase through configurator upsells", "$347/month Shopify fees saved (paid for itself in 4 months)", "28% fewer support tickets", "Client 'extremely happy'"]

## Case Study 7: Raize The Vibe (Meta - Keep)

### What to Change:

**Challenge:**
- Update to emphasize: "Most agencies have boring websites. We needed to practice what we preach AND qualify leads without wasting time on discovery calls with people who aren't a fit."

**Solution:**
- Update to emphasize: "This interactive vibe check quiz you just took. It's lead qualification + personality test + product demonstration. The treasure hunt, custom emojis, PDF generation, AI personalization — all stuff we'd build for clients, applied to ourselves."
