## The "We Love Them" Story

Most agencies charge $3K-$5K/month for what we deliver at $400/week. Why? Because SimsCo is the kind of client that makes this work fun.

**What they get for $400/week:**
- Complete local SEO domination
- Social media content and management
- Lead generation that actually works
- Website optimization and updates
- Reputation management
- Strategic consulting
- And honestly, whatever else they need

**What we get:**

- Freedom to execute without bureaucracy
- The satisfaction of watching a local business win
- Multiple paying jobs per week we can point to and say "we did that"

**The math:** $1,600/month for results that would cost $5K+ elsewhere. They know it. We know it. Nobody's changing a thing.

## What We've Built Over 7 Months

### Local SEO Domination

**The Problem:**
SimsCo had the skills but not the visibility. Great plumbers, invisible online. In the service business, that's called "starving with full toolboxes."

**What We Did:**
- **Google Business Profile Optimization**
  - Professional photos
  - Service area expansion
  - Regular posts and updates
  - Review generation system
  - Q&A optimization
  - Local keyword domination

- **Citation Building & Cleanup**
  - Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across 40+ directories
  - Industry-specific listings (Angie's List, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack)
  - Local business directories
  - Removed duplicate/incorrect listings

- **On-Page SEO**
  - Service pages for every offering
  - Local keyword optimization
  - Schema markup implementation
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Page speed optimization

**The Results:**
- Multiple first-page rankings for "plumber [city name]"
- Featured in Google Local 3-Pack for primary keywords
- Increased organic visibility by 300%+ (conservative estimate)
- Phone rings from Google searches daily

### Social Media That Actually Generates Leads

**The Reality Check:**
Most plumbing company social media is either:
1. Stock photos of pipes (boring)
2. Random memes (unprofessional)
3. Completely abandoned (probably the smartest choice)

**Our Approach:**
- **Content Strategy:**
  - Before/after job photos
  - Educational content ("Why is my water heater making that noise?")
  - Seasonal maintenance tips
  - Team member spotlights
  - Customer testimonials (with permission)
  - Local community involvement

- **Platform Focus:**
  - Facebook (where their customers actually are)
  - Google Business (where buying decisions happen)
  - Limited Instagram (because grandmas hiring plumbers aren't on TikTok)

- **Posting Schedule:**
  - 3-4x per week (consistent, not overwhelming)
  - Best times based on audience analytics
  - Mix of educational, promotional, and community content

**Results:**
- Direct messages from Facebook → booked jobs
- Share buttons actually getting used
- Community engagement (neighbors recommending them)
- Brand recognition in local market

### The Lead Generation Machine

**What "Multiple Paying Jobs Per Week" Actually Means:**

**Week 1 Example (June 2025):**
- Monday: Facebook post about AC maintenance → 2 service calls
- Wednesday: Google Business post about water heater special → 3 quotes requested
- Friday: Customer review response → neighbor saw it → new install job

**Month Average:**
- 8-12 qualified leads from organic social media
- 15-20 leads from improved Google visibility
- 5-8 direct bookings from website improvements
- **Total:** 30-40 new opportunities monthly from our work

**Conversion Rate:**
- Estimated 30-40% of leads → booked jobs
- Average job value: $300-$2,500
- Monthly revenue impact: $5,000-$15,000+

**The Math That Makes Us Both Happy:**
- Client pays: $1,600/month
- Revenue generated: $5,000-$15,000/month (conservative)
- ROI: 300-900%
- Jobs we can trace directly: Multiple per week

### Website Improvements & Optimization

**What We Fixed:**
- Mobile responsiveness (plumbing emergencies happen on phones)
- Page load speed (slow sites = lost emergency calls)
- Clear CTAs (Call Now buttons that actually work)
- Service area pages (every neighborhood they serve)
- Emergency service prominence (24/7 plumbing pays bills)
- Trust indicators (reviews, certifications, local presence)

**Results:**
- Bounce rate decreased
- Time on site increased
- Contact form submissions up
- Direct phone calls from site up
- Mobile conversions improved significantly

## The "Why This Works" Breakdown

### 1. **We Actually Care**
This isn't a templated "plumber SEO package." We treat SimsCo like the $4K/month clients. Why? Because that's how we operate.

### 2. **Local Market Understanding**
We're not pushing national SEO strategies. We're dominating the local service area. Different game. Better results.

### 3. **Consistent Execution**
Every. Single. Week. No gaps. No excuses. No "we'll get to it next month."

### 4. **Results-Focused**
We don't report on "impressions" or "engagement rate." We track: Did the phone ring? Did they book jobs? End of story.

### 5. **Trust Without Bureaucracy**
They trust us. We execute. No approval committees. No three-week revision cycles. Just work.

## Lessons Learned

### What Works For Local Service Businesses:
1. **Google Business Profile is EVERYTHING** - More important than fancy websites
2. **Reviews are currency** - One 5-star review = 10 marketing emails
3. **Consistency beats creativity** - Weekly basics beat monthly genius
4. **Mobile-first isn't optional** - Emergencies happen on phones
5. **Local SEO ≠ National SEO** - Different strategies, better ROI
6. **Trust builds empires** - 7 months of trust > 7 years of contracts

### What Doesn't Work:
1. Trying to be "viral" (you're a plumber, not an influencer)
2. National SEO strategies for local businesses
3. Inconsistent posting (algorithm kills you)
4. Ignoring Google Business (biggest mistake)
5. Complicated funnels (just make the phone ring)
6. Overthinking it (simple executed > complex planned)

## The Bottom Line

**Investment:** $400/week × 7 months = $11,200
**Revenue Impact:** $5,000-$15,000/month (conservative) = $35,000-$105,000 over 7 months
**ROI:** 300-900%+
**Relationship:** Priceless

**What This Proves:**
You don't need a $5K/month budget to dominate local search. You need:
- Smart strategy focused on what actually drives calls
- Consistent execution (not flashy, just consistent)
- Local market understanding
- Trust in your team
- Commitment to the basics done exceptionally well

**The Raize Philosophy:**
We charge what's fair and deliver what's exceptional. SimsCo gets $5K-quality work for $1,600/month because we love working with businesses that appreciate quality and hustle.
