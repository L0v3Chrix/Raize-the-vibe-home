# Case Study: ReLid USA
## When Your Product IS The Design

**Client:** ReLid USA
**Engagement:** Custom website build (one-off project)
**Completed:** December 2025
**Industry:** Aluminum Packaging Technology / Industrial Design
**Product:** Revolutionary resealable aluminum can-end technology
**Client Satisfaction:** Extremely happy

---

## The "This Is Different" Brief

Most clients come to us with vague ideas. ReLid USA came with:
- A revolutionary product (licensed from ReLid Europe)
- Engineering specs that would make MIT jealous
- A European website that was good (but not good enough for America)
- A clear vision: **"Bold American engineering meets modern sustainability"**
- One mandate: Make it stronger, more premium, and more advanced than Europe

**Translation:** Build a website that makes a can lid look like the future.

---

## The Challenge

**The Product:** A resealable aluminum can-end that's:
- More durable than plastic alternatives
- Fully recyclable (aluminum loop economy)
- Compatible with 5+ can sizes
- Patent-pending American engineering
- Launching Chicago production in 2025

**The Problem:**
How do you make people care about... a can lid?

**The Bigger Problem:**
Their European counterpart's website had:
- Lifestyle photos (bee on a lid? really?)
- Cluttered WordPress layouts
- Outdated design language
- Too much fluff, not enough engineering credibility

**Our Mission:**
Create a website that says "This is premium American industrial engineering" not "Here's another beverage accessory."

## What Made This Work

### 1. **We Respected The Product**
This isn't just a can lid. It's patent-pending engineering. We treated it that way.

### 2. **We Understood The Audience**
B2B buyers (beverage brands) don't want lifestyle photos. They want:
- Technical specifications
- Engineering credibility
- Compatibility proof
- Durability data
- Partnership confidence

### 3. **We Challenged The Brief**
Client wanted better than Europe. We asked: "What does American engineering actually look like?" Then we built that.

### 4. **We Designed For The Product**
The product IS premium industrial design. The website had to match that energy. Block colors. Strong contrast. Minimal text. Engineering precision.

### 5. **We Avoided Common Mistakes**
- NO lifestyle photos (not a consumer product)
- NO testimonials (B2B credibility comes from specs, not reviews)
- NO unnecessary videos (engineers want data, not storytelling)
- NO cluttered layouts (premium = clean and precise)

## The Design Philosophy

**"The Product IS The Design"**

When your product is this engineered, this innovative, and this visually striking, the website shouldn't compete with it. The website should showcase it.

**Our Approach:**
1. Let the 3D renders breathe (white space is power)
2. Use color strategically (not decoratively)
3. Write only what matters (engineers hate fluff)
4. Show technical precision (exploded views, blueprints)
5. Build credibility through design (not words)

**Design Decisions:**
- Dark backgrounds = technology and engineering
- Bright accent blocks = category benefits
- Large spacing = premium positioning
- Minimal text = confidence (we don't need to oversell)
- Block-color sectioning = visual clarity
- Engineering aesthetic = product alignment

## Lessons Learned

### What Works For Technical/Industrial Products:

1. **Respect The Engineering**
   - Don't dumb it down
   - Don't make it "friendly"
   - Let the technical precision shine

2. **Visual Hierarchy Matters**
   - 3D renders should dominate
   - Text should support, not compete
   - White space creates premium feel

3. **Color Psychology For B2B**
   - Black = serious engineering
   - Aluminum grey = product material authenticity
   - Green = sustainability credibility
   - Blue = technology confidence
   - Red = American boldness

4. **Minimalism ≠ Boring**
   - Less text = more impact
   - Clean layout = premium positioning
   - Strategic color = visual interest

5. **European ≠ American**
   - Europe: Design-forward, softer
   - America: Bold, engineered, confident
   - Same product, different positioning

### What Doesn't Work:

1. **Lifestyle photos for industrial products**
   (A bee on a lid doesn't sell to Coca-Cola)

2. **Consumer marketing language for B2B**
   (Engineers want specs, not aspirations)

3. **Cluttered layouts**
   (Premium products need room to breathe)

4. **Trying to make engineering "accessible"**
   (Your buyers are engineers. Speak their language.)

5. **Following beverage brand playbooks**
   (You're selling TO beverage brands, not competing with them)

## The Brand Brief We Created

**Creative North Star:**
> "Bold American engineering meets modern sustainability."

**Design Must Always Reflect:**
- Innovation (we're launching new technology)
- Precision (engineering excellence)
- Strength (American durability)
- Practicality (it actually works)
- Sustainability (environmental responsibility)
- Proud American identity (Chicago production, U.S. innovation)

**The Difference:**
This isn't a beverage brand. This is an engineering company selling to beverage brands. Every design decision flows from that truth.
